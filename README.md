# StudentPrediction

## Overview
The project utilizes a linear regression model to predict the final grades of students based on various features.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

 - main.py: The main Python script that contains the implementation of the job recruiter model.
 - student-mat.csv: The dataset containing student information, including grades, study time, absences, and failures.
 - studentmodel.pickle: A serialized version of the trained linear regression model.


## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to execute the program:
 python main.py

3. The program will load the dataset, train the linear regression model, and output the accuracy of the model on the test data.
4. The trained model will be saved in the studentmodel.pickle file.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Data
The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in the student-mat.csv file. It contains the following columns:

- G1: Grade in the first period
- G2: Grade in the second period
- G3: Final grade (target variable)
- studytime: Weekly study time (1-4)
- absences: Number of absences
- failures: Number of past class failures
 
## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R^2 score). The closer the R^2 score is to 1, the better the model fits the data.

## Future Improvements
Here are some potential areas for future improvements:

- Explore different machine learning algorithms and compare their performance.
- Perform feature engineering to create additional meaningful features.
- Conduct hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
- Enhance the visualization of the results.
